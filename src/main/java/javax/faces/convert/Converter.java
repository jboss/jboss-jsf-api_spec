/**
 * <p><strong class="changed_modified_2_0">Converter</strong> is an
 * interface describing a Java class that can perform Object-to-String
 * and String-to-Object conversions between model data objects and a
 * String representation of those objects that is suitable for
 * rendering.</p>

 * <p/>
 * <p>{@link Converter} implementations must have a zero-arguments public
 * constructor.  In addition, if the {@link Converter} class wishes to have
 * configuration property values saved and restored with the component tree,
 * the implementation must also implement {@link StateHolder}.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>Starting with version 1.2 of the specification, an exception to the above
 * zero-arguments constructor requirement has been introduced.  If a converter has
 * a single argument constructor that takes a <code>Class</code> instance and
 * the <code>Class</code> of the data to be converted is
 * known at converter instantiation time, this constructor
 * must be used to instantiate the converter instead of the zero-argument
 * version.  This enables the per-class conversion
 * of Java enumerated types.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>If any <code>Converter</code> implementation requires a
 * <code>java.util.Locale</code> to perform its job, it must obtain that
 * <code>Locale</code> from the {@link javax.faces.component.UIViewRoot}
 * of the current {@link FacesContext}, unless the
 * <code>Converter</code> maintains its own <code>Locale</code> as part
 * of its state.</p>
 *
 * <p class="changed_added_2_0">If the class implementing
 * <code>Converter</code> has a {@link
 * javax.faces.application.ResourceDependency} annotation, the action
 * described in <code>ResourceDependency</code> must be taken when
 * {@link javax.faces.component.ValueHolder#setConverter} is called.
 * If the class implementing <code>Converter</code> has a {@link
 * javax.faces.application.ResourceDependencies} annotation, the
 * action described in <code>ResourceDependencies</code> must be taken 
 * when {@link javax.faces.component.ValueHolder#setConverter} is called.</p>
