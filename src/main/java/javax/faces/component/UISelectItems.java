 * <code>value</code> of this component (set either directly, or acquired
 * indirectly a {@link javax.el.ValueExpression}, can be of any
 * of the following types:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>Single instance of {@link SelectItem}</em> - This instance is
 *     added to the set of available options for the parent tag.</li>
 * <li><em>Array of {@link SelectItem}</em> - This set of instances is
 *     added to the set of available options for the parent component,
 *     in ascending subscript order.</li>
 * <li><em>Collection of {@link SelectItem}</em> - This set of instances is
 *     added to the set of available options for the parent component,
 *     in the order provided by an iterator over them.</li>
 * <li><em>Map</em> - The keys of this object (once converted to
 *     Strings) are assumed to be labels, and the values of this object
 *     (once converted to Strings)
 *     are assumed to be values, of {@link SelectItem} instances that will
 *     be constructed dynamically and added to the set of available options
 *     for the parent component, in the order provided by an iterator over
