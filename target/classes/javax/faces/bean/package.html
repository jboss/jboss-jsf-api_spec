<p class="changed_added_2_0">These javadoc files constitute the
&#8220;Faces Managed Bean Annotation Specification for Containers
Conforming to Servlet 2.5 and Beyond&#8221;</p>

<div class="changed_added_2_0">

<p>At the time of this writing, a forthcoming JCP effort is being
planned to extract the specification for managed beans from JSF and
place it into its own specification.  To account for this effort and to
avoid introducing classes into JSF 2.0 that would have to be deprecated
when this effort is complete, implementations of JSF 2.0 are not
required to implement the &#8220;Faces Managed Bean Annotation
Specification for Containers Conforming to Servlet 2.5&#8221;.  However,
JSF implementations are strongly encouraged to implement this
specification, as it provides significant improvements in ease of
use.</p>

<p>The annotations must be processed as specified in section JSF.11.5.1.</p>
